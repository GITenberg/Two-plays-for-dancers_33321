<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In a note at the end of my last book 'The Wild
Swans at Coole' (Cuala Press.) I explained why I
preferred this kind of drama, and where I had found
my models, and where and how my first play after
this kind was performed, and when and how I would
have it performed in the future. I can but refer the
reader to the note or to the long introduction to
'Certain Noble Plays of Japan' (Cuala Press.)</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>W. B. Yeats. October 11th. 1918</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>P. S. That I might write 'The Dreaming of the
Bones,' Mr. W. A. Henderson with great kindness
wrote out for me all historical allusions to Dervorgilla.</p>

<p>The stage is any bare place in a room close to the
wall. A screen with a pattern of mountain and sky
can stand against the wall, or a curtain with a like
pattern hang upon it, but the pattern must only
symbolize or suggest. One musician enters and then
two others, the first stands singing while the others
take their places. Then all three sit down against
the wall by their instruments, which are already
there&mdash;a drum, a zither, and a flute. Or they unfold
a cloth as in 'The Hawk's Well,' while the instruments
are carried in.</p>


<h4>FIRST MUSICIAN</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">(or all three musicians, singing)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why does my heart beat so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not a shadow pass?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It passed but a moment ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can have trod in the grass?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What rogue is night-wandering?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have not old writers said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dizzy dreams can spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the dry bones of the dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a night it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the valley fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those fantastic dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They overflow the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So passionate is a shade,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p002" id="Page_p002">[Pg 2]</a></span><span class="i0">Like wine that fills to the top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grey-green cup of jade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or maybe an agate cup.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(speaking) The hour before dawn and the moon covered up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little village of Abbey is covered up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little narrow trodden way that runs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the white road to the Abbey of Corcomroe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is covered up; and all about the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are like a circle of Agate or of Jade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere among great rocks on the scarce grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birds cry, they cry their loneliness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the sunlight can be lonely here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even hot noon is lonely. I hear a footfall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young man with a lantern comes this way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seems an Aran fisher, for he wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flannel bawneen and the cow-hide shoe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stumbles wearily, and stumbling prays.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(A young man enters, praying in Irish)</p>
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once more the birds cry in their loneliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now they wheel about our heads; and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have dropped on the grey stone to the north-east.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(A man and a girl both in the costume of a past time,
come in. They wear heroic masks)</p>

<p>(The Girl blows out lantern)</p>
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind has blown my lantern out. Where are you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a pair of heads against the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lost them after, but you are in the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should not be afraid in County Clare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should be or should not be have no choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have to put myself into your hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that my candle's out.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You know some place of refuge, have some plan<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">I am to lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At daybreak on the mountain and keep watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until an Aran coracle puts in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Muckanish or at the rocky shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Finvarra, but would break my neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I went stumbling there alone in the dark.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We know the pathways that the sheep tread out,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You'd say they had better before English robbers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut down the trees or set them upon fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear their owners might find shelter there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is that sound?<br /></span>

<span class="r0">An old horse gone astray<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I took him for a man and horse. Police<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are out upon the roads. In the late Rising<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think there was no man of us but hated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fire at soldiers who but did their duty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And were not of our race, but when a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is born in Ireland and of Irish stock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he takes part against us&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some are consumed in fire, some withered up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hail and sleet out of the wintry North,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(speaking) They've passed the shallow well and the flat stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fouled by the drinking cattle, the narrow lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mourners for five centuries have carried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noble or peasant to his burial.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An owl is crying out above their heads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(singing) Why should the heart take fright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sets it beating so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter sweetness of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has made it but a lonely thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red bird of March, begin to crow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Red cock, and crow.<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p007" id="Page_p007">[Pg 7]</a></span><span class="i0">And passed the ragged thorn trees and the gap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the ancient hedge; and the tomb-nested owl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the foot's level beats with a vague wing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(singing) My head is in a cloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd let the whole world go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My rascal heart is proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering and remembering.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red bird of March, begin to crow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cat-headed bird is crying out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(singing) The dreaming bones cry out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the night winds blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven's a cloudy blot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calamity can have its fling.<br /></span>

<h4>THE STRANGER</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We're almost at the summit and can rest.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the old days we should have heard a bell<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p008" id="Page_p008">[Pg 8]</a></span><span class="i0">Calling the monks before day broke to pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the day has broken on the ridge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Broken by wind and frost and worn by time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Donogh O'Brien has a tomb, a name in Latin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wore fine clothes and knew the secrets of women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he rebelled against the King of Thomond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died in his youth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>YOUNG MAN</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">And why should he rebel?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King of Thomond was his rightful master.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was men like Donogh who made Ireland weak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My curse on all that troop, and when I die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll leave my body, if I have any choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from his ivy tod and his owl; have those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, if your tale is true, work out a penance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the mountain-top where I am to hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come from the Abbey graveyard?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Warred in the heat of the blood; if they were rebels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some momentary impulse made them rebels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the comandment of some petty king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hated Thomond. Being but common sinners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No callers in of the alien from oversea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They and their enemies of Thomond's party<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mix in a brief dream battle above their bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or make one drove or drift in amity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the hurry of the heavenly round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget their earthly names; these are alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being accursed.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<h4>YOUNG MAN</h4>

<span class="i0">To drive the living, should they meet its face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crazy, and be a terror to the dead.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">But these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were comely even in their middle life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry, now that they are dead, the image<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their first youth, for it was in that youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sin began.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>YOUNG MAN</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">I have heard of angry ghosts<br /></span>

<h4>THE GIRL</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These have no thought but love; nor joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that upon the instant when their penance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws to its height and when two hearts are wrung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearest to breaking, if hearts of shadows break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes can mix with hers; nor any pang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is so bitter as that double glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being accursed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>YOUNG MAN</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">But what is this strange penance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when their eyes have met can wring them most?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>THE GIRL</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though eyes can meet, their lips can never meet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
